         <h1>About Me</h1>
         <p>
         I am a student that goes to J.P Taravella High school. I'm a freshman and it is okay here.
         I like soccer and I'm going to try out at the school but, there's a lot of people going to 
         try out and its going to be hard but I know I can do this. I'm trying to do good in school
         by working hard and getting good grades.
